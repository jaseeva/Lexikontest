# Lexikontest
A tool to help me learn new words in German :)

Functionality:
- get list of words with attributes and parse it to create objects
- quiz for word translation with random words from the list
- store dictionary with added words as csv file
- management of dictionary files in case of invalid data
- user can add new words or practice what he added before
- show correct answers for wrong words in quiz results
- words have counter for how often they are answered correctly. Words for quiz are selected based on this parameter.
- reverse quiz type: user sees translation and should write original word (with article in case of Noun)

Planned:
- [ ] add GUI
- [ ] make web version
